THIS IS A DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR GRAD 521.

The research questions are: 

a. What is the carbon sequestration potential of CWS land pre and post restoration(years 0, 1, 5 10)?

b. How do N, P, K, S, and other soil constituents change post restoration?

c. Which soil mycorrhizae are present pre/post restoration?

I hypothesize that carbon sequestration potential changes over time after the riparian restoration has occurred due to the establishment of restored species which stabilize and input carbon to the soil environment.
I predict 10 years post restoration will have the greatest potential for carbon sequestration compared to younger sites.
 

I will take an observational approach to sample three sites for year 0 and each year post restoration (year 1, 5, and 10). Within each site I will randomly select three plots to take four core samples. Three cores will be used to sample soil nutrients while one core will be processed to determine mycorrhizae presence. Each core will have three soil layers: 0-10, 10-20, and 10-30 cm. By taking these core layers we can determine how carbon and other nutrients change and are stored after restoration and how the mycorrhizal communities shift post restoration. 

The goals are to understand how carbon accumulates after inland, riparian restoration treatments to inform the management actions of CWS and other restoration groups when conducting wetland restoration projects. By obtaining a baseline for typical restoration projects, we may research other influences on carbon sequestration, such as restoration plant selection.
