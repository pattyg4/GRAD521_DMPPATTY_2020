THIS IS A DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR GRAD 521.
1. The main research questions are: 

a. How do mycorrhizal populations shift after restoration treatments are applied to an area, specifically shifting from a 100 year-old farmland to a wetland/riparian area?

b. Which plant species have the most survivability when pioneering wetland/riparian restoration from agricultural land?

I hypothesize that plant species capable of making many symbiotic, ectomycorrhizal relationships have greater survivability than those capable of making limited or specialized connections. 

I predict over a four year period to see a shift in the mycorrhizal populations, with greater diversity after the restoration treatment. 

I will take an experimental approach, where I will have 5 planted replicates with 5 experimental plots (4 planted areas and one control group with nothing planted). Each experimental plot will be one-square-acre and contain a single, planted species typically used for restoration. When sampled before and after restoration, the sample method with be stratified to the middle of the plot to account for edge effects, but the soil and plant root samples will be randomized.
