# Data Management Plan

## Data Description
The example provided for the “LTREB: Drivers of temperate forest carbon storage from canopy closure through successional time” seemed very straight forward, so I will emulated that. I plan on producing three types of data:

a.	Physical samples: These samples will be collected pre and post restoration treatment and will include soil and root samples. The soil samples will have a bulked soil component, while the other will be cold stored and processed to determine mycorrhizal populations. Each sample will be save based on a numerical system associated to each plot.

b.	Field observations: Pre-restoration the GPS location, elevation, soil series evaluation, parent material, plant species, soil/air temperatures and humidity will be documented for each plot. Post-restoration, these same observations will be documented, along with stress monitoring for planted species. Stress monitoring will look for signs of desiccation, disease, predation, or death. These data will be documented on hard copy data sheet, which will be digitalized as PDF/As. They will then be complied for examination after the experimental time is complete. 

c.	Laboratory data: A combination of hard copy and digital data sets will record the soil laboratory analysis outputs, which will include mass, nutrient content (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and carbon content). The mycorrhizal samples from the soil and roots will have the amplified RNA sequence of the 18S gene (the typical gene sequence for fungi). They will be complied and compared to the datasets existing in the “Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)” from the National Center for Biotechnology Information to determine the mycorrhizal populations for each plot and root association.

For each data type the amount of data generated will be as follows:

a.	Physical samples: 50 MB

b.	Field observations: 50 MB

c.	Laboratory data: upwards of 1 TB depending on how many mycorrhizal RNA sequences are present. 

## Roles and Responsibilities
•	The final responsibility for data management, which includes DMP implementation, data organization, quality control, metadata generation, and data archiving rests with the Master’s student, G. Patty. Patty is also responsible for data dissemination once the final products are produced.

•	Data collection is the primary responsibility of Patty, but additional data collection help and research area maintenance will be shared with the senior field manager of Clean Water Services, J. Goetz, and possibly a field technician. 

•	Laboratory analysis and instrument maintenance will be the primary responsibility of Patty, with additional direction from Hatten Soils Lab manager I and the Biodeterioration Lab Senior Faculty Research Assistant. Patty will receive help with the soil samples determining the bulked soil mass and the nutrient contents in the Hatten lab, while in the Biodeterioration Lab, mycorrhizal samples will be processed for DNA sequencing.

•	Data and statistical analysis is the responsibility of Patty, but much direction will be provided by the College of Forestry’s statistician. 

•	If someone were to leave the project, the research would likely fall upon the senior field manager for Clean Water Services, as they own the land and they are funding the research. This may also mean the research becomes proprietary data for Clean Water Services unless they find another graduate student. 

•	There are no data sharing requirements, non-disclosure agreements, nor sensitive and confidential data generate by this project. The goals of this projects are increase the scope and success of restoration by sharing the results with anyone engaged in restoration, both for profit and non-profit groups.
